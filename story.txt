**Story**

Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who resided near a berry tree, whic was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived an Angry Bird  named Red  who lived on the other side of the river. 
The monkey was very kind hearted so he offered red some fruits as he loved them. As days passed by, the Angry Bird and the Monkey became very good friends.
